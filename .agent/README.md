**Read this first.** Files in this directory are project-specific instructions for AI agents.

## Hard Rules (non-negotiable)

1. **Never delete or modify existing code comments** without explicit approval.
   - Chinese comments are authoritative — they may be self-criticism, TODOs, or design context. When in doubt, ask.
2. **Ask before guessing**. Propose a brief plan first, wait for confirmation, then implement.
3. **Commit only when asked**, using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) (`feat/fix/refactor/docs/chore(scope): description`).
4. **Proactively fix** English grammar, typos, and code style issues. Call out tech choices, naming, or design problems you disagree with.

## Files

| File | Read when... | Purpose |
|------|--------------|---------|
| `notes.md` | **Always** | Hard rules for code modification and directory naming. |
| `guide.md` | Working on code (Rust, DB, APIs) | Tech stack, crudly ORM usage, API endpoints, pitfalls. |
| `retrospective.md` | Optional | Past session lessons — mistakes to avoid, technical tips. |

Start with `notes.md`. Read `guide.md` before writing Rust code. Skip `retrospective.md` unless you want context on prior mistakes.
